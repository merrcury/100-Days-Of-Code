# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 0 : January 05, 2020
 
**Today's Progress** : Start of Learning New Machine Learning Platform, H2O. Completed the Pre-Requisite and platform set-up required for H2O. 

**Thoughts** : Hope this will be inspiring, will help me in learning Machine Learning on Big Data more efficiently.

## Day 1 : January 06, 2018

**Today's Progress** : 
+ Started of My Journey with Book "Practical Machine Learning with H2O: Powerful, Scalable Techniques for Deep Learning and AI" By "Darren Cook".  
+ Got familiar with terms and pattern involved in H2O with a sample use case. 

**Thoughts** : H2O Flow seems impressive and will be saving time when I will use H2O in real-life Projects

## Day 2: January 07, 2018

**Today's Progress** : 
+ Started with some famous algorithms of H2O and tried to learn what they bring extra to the plate.
+ Applied on same old-school IRIS Dataset to get insights. 

**Thoughts** : Why I haven't tried this out before?
