# 100 Days Of Code - LOG

## Day 0 : January 05, 2020
 
**Today's Progress**: Start of Learning New Machine Learning Platform, H2O. Completed the Pre-Requisite and platform set-up required for H2O. 

**Thoughts**: Hope this will be inspiring, will help me in learning Machine Learning on Big Data more efficiently.

## Day 1: January 06, 2020

**Today's Progress** : 
+ Started of My Journey with Book "Practical Machine Learning with H2O: Powerful, Scalable Techniques for Deep Learning and AI" By "Darren Cook".  
+ Got familiar with terms and pattern involved in H2O with a sample use case. 

**Thoughts**: H2O Flow seems impressive and will be saving time when I will use H2O in real-life Projects

## Day 3: January 08, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I work on time-series data a lot and generally follow the approach of lots of tests and ARIMA & SARIMA. A Project is coming my way with Time Series Analysis. So, I thought of giving Facebook Prophet a test drive. I have done a simple Stock Forecasting & Cross-Validation on same. I am neutral about results because Results are just good enough without tunning. 

**Thoughts**: Facebook's Prophet seems pretty good. I guess It can save me the significant time of test and re-modelling data for ARIMA.
