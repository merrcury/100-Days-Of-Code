**Today's Progress** : Start of Learning New Machine Learning Platform, H2O. Completed the Pre-Requisite and platform set-up required for H2O. 

**Thoughts** : Hope this will be inspiring, will help me in learning Machine Learning on Big Data more efficiently.

## Day 1 : January 06 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : 
+ Started of My Journey with Book "Practical Machine Learning with H2O: Powerful, Scalable Techniques for Deep Learning and AI" By "Darren Cook".  
+ Got familiar with terms and pattern involved in H2O with a sample use case.
