# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 0 : January 05, 2020
 
**Today's Progress** : Start of Learning New Machine Learning Platform, H2O. Completed the Pre-Requisite and platform set-up required for H2O. 

**Thoughts** : Hope this will be inspiring, will help me in learning Machine Learning on Big Data more efficiently.

## Day 1 : January 06, 2020

**Today's Progress** : 
+ Started of My Journey with Book "Practical Machine Learning with H2O: Powerful, Scalable Techniques for Deep Learning and AI" By "Darren Cook".  
+ Got familiar with terms and pattern involved in H2O with a sample use case. 

**Thoughts** : H2O Flow seems impressive and will be saving time when I will use H2O in real-life Projects

## Day 2 : January 07, 2020

**Today's Progress** : 
+ Started with some famous algorithms of H2O and tried to learn what they bring extra to the plate.
+ Applied on same old-school IRIS Dataset to get insights. 

**Thoughts** : Why I haven't tried this out before?

## Day 3 : January 08, 2020

**Today's Progress** : I work on time-series data a lot and generally follow the approach of lots of tests and ARIMA & SARIMA. A Project is coming my way with Time Series Analysis. So, I thought of giving Facebook Prophet a test drive. I have done a simple Stock Forecasting & Cross-Validation on same. I am neutral about results because Results are just good enough without tunning. 

**Thoughts** : Facebook's Prophet seems pretty good. I guess It can save me the significant time of test and re-modelling data for ARIMA.

## Day 4 : January 09, 2020

**Today's Progress** :  
+ Today, I contributed to Facebook's Prophet by opening a Pull Request. 
+ I have started working on a Machine Learning Challenge released by HackerEarth. 
+ I have achieved the score of 85.81337 & stands in Top 10, on Day-1 of Challenge. 

**Thoughts** : HackerEarth challenges are good for Intermediate and I hope to remain at Top by end of challenge. 

**Link of Work** : I'll be uploading my competition work after competition got over.

## Day 5 : January 10, 2020

**Today's Progress** : I did some Visualization & Cleaning of Dataset for HackerEarth ML Challenge and resumed by H2O learning.

**Thoughts** : How about using H2O for this challenge? I guess, I'll implement H2O this time. 

## Day 6 : January 11, 2020

**Today's Progress** : 
+ I am a Hackathon Enthusiast and Smart India Hackathon is coming. So, I started working on ideation of that. In which, I am learning to deploy Machine Learning model for automation.
+ In HackerEarth Challenge, I am not getting significant changes in score with GBM. So, I started my journey of Stacked Ensemble.

**Thoughts** : SIH brought too much to plate. I need to up my game now.

## Day 7 : January 12, 2020

**Today's Progress** : 
+ After weeks of research, I finally submitted a project proposal for a hackathon
+ I am still figuring out how a Stacked Ensemble work mathematically

**Thoughts** : At one point in ML, We think situation is under control but in next minute, It isn't. 

**Thoughts** : SIH brought too much to plate. I need to up my game now.

## Day 8 : January 13, 2020

**Today's Progress** : 
+ Discussing Ideas related to SIH. 
+ Cleared a person's query on Facebook Dev Group regarding ML & created a kaggle notebook for same.

**Thoughts** : Research & Data Building is part of Data Science and doing same has its own challenge and I am delighted to do it for my team.

## Day 9 : January 14, 2020

**Today's Progress** : Helping out people in tackling Machine Learning Problems. Helped out a person from LinkedIn. 

**Thoughts** : These 10 days passed very swiftly. 

## Day 10 : January 15, 2020

**Today's Progress** : Updated code of some Older Projects.  

**Thoughts** : You learn new techniques & find your older code is a mess. 

## Day 11 : January 16, 2020

**Today's Progress** : You complete what you start, completing the updation.   

**Thoughts** : I should follow style guidelines from now.

## Day 12 : January 17, 2020

**Today's Progress** : I resumed my work for HackerEarth Challenge.

**Thoughts** : Tomorrow, I have an developing assignment & I'm looking forward to it.
