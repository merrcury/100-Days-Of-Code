# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 0 : January 05, 2020
 
**Today's Progress** : Start of Learning New Machine Learning Platform, H2O. Completed the Pre-Requisite and platform set-up required for H2O. 

**Thoughts** : Hope this will be inspiring, will help me in learning Machine Learning on Big Data more efficiently.

## Day 1 : January 06, 2020

**Today's Progress** : 
+ Started of My Journey with Book "Practical Machine Learning with H2O: Powerful, Scalable Techniques for Deep Learning and AI" By "Darren Cook".  
+ Got familiar with terms and pattern involved in H2O with a sample use case. 

**Thoughts** : H2O Flow seems impressive and will be saving time when I will use H2O in real-life Projects

## Day 2 : January 07, 2020

**Today's Progress** : 
+ Started with some famous algorithms of H2O and tried to learn what they bring extra to the plate.
+ Applied on same old-school IRIS Dataset to get insights. 

**Thoughts** : Why I haven't tried this out before?

## Day 3 : January 08, 2020

**Today's Progress** : I work on time-series data a lot and generally follow the approach of lots of tests and ARIMA & SARIMA. A Project is coming my way with Time Series Analysis. So, I thought of giving Facebook Prophet a test drive. I have done a simple Stock Forecasting & Cross-Validation on same. I am neutral about results because Results are just good enough without tunning. 

**Thoughts** : Facebook's Prophet seems pretty good. I guess It can save me the significant time of test and re-modelling data for ARIMA.

**Thoughts** : How about using H2O for this challenge? I guess, I'll implement H2O this time. 

## Day 6 : January 11, 2020

**Today's Progress** : 
+ I am a Hackathon Enthusiast and Smart India Hackathon is coming. So, I started working on ideation of that. In which, I am learning to deploy Machine Learning model for automation.

**Thoughts** : SIH brought too much to plate. I need to up my game now.

## Day 8 : January 13, 2020

**Today's Progress** : 
+ Discussing Ideas related to SIH. 
+ Cleared a person's query on Facebook Dev Group regarding ML & created a kaggle notebook for same.
